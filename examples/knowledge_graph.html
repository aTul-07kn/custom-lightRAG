Overall, clinical trials are essential for advancing cancer treatment and are strongly encouraged for patients diagnosed with metastatic cancer to explore state-of-the-art therapeutic options."}, {"color": "#3f74f3", "created_at": 1755425010, "description": "Drug interactions refer to how different medications and supplements can affect the efficacy of systemic therapies in treating cancer.", "entity_id": "Drug Interactions", "entity_type": "category", "file_path": "unknown_source", "id": "Drug Interactions", "label": "Drug Interactions", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "source_id": "chunk-3d76cb561a911d6e336a4929cbfd2343", "title": "Drug interactions refer to how different medications and supplements can affect the efficacy of systemic therapies in treating cancer."}, {"color": "#806389", "created_at": 1755425078, "description": "Side effects are adverse reactions experienced by patients as a result of various cancer treatments including RAI and radiation.", "entity_id": "Side Effects", "entity_type": "category", "file_path": "unknown_source", "id": "Side Effects", "label": "Side Effects", "shape": "dot", "size": 10, "source_id": "chunk-84c5990acb652b59cc83a3731632a717", "title": "Side effects are adverse reactions experienced by patients as a result of various cancer treatments including RAI and radiation."}, {"color": "#32e694", "created_at": 1755424822, "description": "Cisplatin is a chemotherapy drug that contains platinum and is widely used in the treatment of various cancers.

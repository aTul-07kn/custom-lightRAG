The introduction of student credit cards in Hong Kong reflects a broader financial inclusion initiative By granting access to credit early, banks aim to build long-term relationships with young customers. This early engagement ensures that students gradually transition into mainstream financial products such as personal loans, mortgages, and premium credit cards after graduation.

In practice, many students use their cards primarily for convenience in transportation (Octopus top-ups), cinema tickets, and food delivery apps. Banks leverage these spending patterns by offering merchant tie-ups with cinemas, cafes, and online platforms popular among the youth.

The Town and the Stranger
Aurendale was the kind of town you didn’t find unless you were already lost. Nestled between two ridges of the Verdant Hollow Mountains and bordered on its west side by the lazy Merrow River, the place had been stubbornly self-contained for centuries. The cobblestone streets, the weathered oak shopfronts, and the faint smell of woodsmoke were the same in 2024 as they had been in 1824.
The population hovered around 6,203 — not counting the transient hikers and the occasional city-weary artist who came to “find themselves.” Tourists tended to gravitate to the weekly Saturday market in Gleam Square, where locals sold everything from pear cider to handwoven scarves.
On March 2nd, 2024, a stranger arrived on the 3:17 PM bus from Bramwell City. His name was Dr. Elias Corven, a man of about fifty with neatly combed silver hair, a leather satchel, and the kind of eyes that seemed to be cataloging every brick in the street. He rented a room above The Brass Lantern Inn, paying in cash — crisp, new bills in sequential order.
Few people noticed him that first day, except Maeve Calder, who ran the flower stall at the market. She later said she remembered him because he bought a single white chrysanthemum and asked, very politely, if she knew where he could find “the old Glass Library.”


The Glass Library’s History
The Glass Library was more legend than location. Officially, it didn’t exist. The town archive contained no maps or building permits. But every child in Aurendale grew up hearing the story:
“Somewhere beneath the hills is a library made entirely of glass — floors, shelves, even the books. It holds the memories of everyone who’s ever lived here, stored as words that only the right person can read.”
The last known “sighting” of the Glass Library was in 1913, when Ivy Bertram, a seamstress’s daughter, claimed to have wandered into a hillside cave and found “corridors of crystal with books that hummed.” She died the following year, and the story slipped into the realm of ghost tales.
But Dr. Corven wasn’t looking for folklore. On his second day in town, he visited the municipal records office, introducing himself to Archivist Henry Vale, a meticulous man of seventy-three. He asked for geological surveys of the area between Redleaf Ridge and Fallow Bend, as well as any old mining maps from before 1880.


Maeve’s Suspicion
Maeve Calder wasn’t a gossip by nature, but she had a habit of noticing patterns. By the end of Corven’s first week, she’d seen him:
Walking the east trail along the Merrow River at sunrise.
Spending two hours sketching the facade of the St. Aurelius Church.
Speaking to Orrin Bexley, the only locksmith in town.
One rainy afternoon, she spotted Corven through the cafe window at Pennyloaf’s, where he was drawing something in a notebook. She could just make out lines and circles that resembled a map. In the corner of one page was a number: 43-Delta-197.
She mentioned it to her friend Tom Brayer, who worked maintenance at the old Bellweather Mine, now a tourist site. Tom shrugged, but admitted that the code looked eerily like the labeling used for sealed mine shafts.


The First Clue
On March 11th, Corven found his first tangible lead. While exploring the overgrown trail behind Ashwood Cemetery, he noticed a set of carved glass panels embedded in the hillside, barely visible under moss. They were arranged like a doorframe, though the “door” was fused solid.
He took measurements, sketched every etched symbol, and carefully recorded the exact coordinates: 47.1924° N, 122.8745° W.
That evening, he visited The Pensive Mug, a cozy tavern run by Greta Mornell, ordering black tea with a splash of milk. He asked Greta, casually, whether she had ever heard the phrase “The Atrium Breathes at Midnight.” Greta paused, said it sounded like an old Aurendale proverb, but couldn’t place it.


The Secret Society
The next morning, Corven awoke to find a folded note slipped under his door. It read:
If you’re looking for the library, meet me at the old clocktower at 11:45 tonight. Come alone. — M
Corven arrived at the clocktower, its bronze face frozen at 2:19 since the great storm of 1978. There, in the shadows, stood Morgan Thistle, a wiry man in his forties with ink-stained fingers. Morgan claimed to be part of the Custodians of the Glass, a secretive group dedicated to guarding the library’s location.
Morgan told Corven that the phrase “The Atrium Breathes at Midnight” referred to a mechanism — a vent system in the hillside that opened only for twelve minutes each night, allowing entry into the underground complex. The catch? The vent was disguised as part of the Cindral Viaduct, a disused railway bridge two miles south of town.


The First Descent
On March 15th, Corven and Morgan attempted their first entry. At exactly 11:58 PM, they located the hidden panel on the viaduct, which swung inward to reveal a narrow, glass-lined tunnel sloping downward. The air was warm and smelled faintly of cedar.
Inside, the corridor branched into three paths. They chose the central one, following a faint pulsing glow. After about two hundred feet, they entered a chamber with transparent shelves holding hundreds of thin, glass tablets. Each tablet contained tiny, shifting letters in no known language.
Morgan explained that only certain people could “read” the library — those whose memories resonated with the stored ones. Corven, skeptical, picked up a tablet and immediately saw images from a childhood trip to Port Lucent, a memory he had not recalled in decades.


The Locked Wing
Deeper inside, they reached a set of immense glass doors marked with the same code Maeve had seen earlier: 43-Delta-197. Morgan said that wing was locked for over a century — ever since an event called The Silencing, when part of the library stopped functioning.
Corven noticed a narrow console beside the doors with seven circular slots. Morgan admitted the keys to these slots were scattered — possibly hidden within town landmarks. One was rumored to be inside the spire of St. Aurelius Church; another beneath the Bellweather Mine’s oldest elevator shaft.
They agreed to search for them together, though Corven did not reveal that he had his own agenda — a missing piece of family history tied to Aurendale.


Maeve Joins the Hunt
When Maeve accidentally overheard part of their conversation at Pennyloaf’s, she confronted Corven directly. Rather than deny it, he invited her to join them. Maeve revealed something shocking — her grandmother, Clara Evensong, had claimed to visit the Glass Library during the winter of 1947 and had returned with a small glass bead she kept on a silver chain.
Maeve still had it. When they placed the bead into one of the circular slots on the library’s locked door, it glowed faintly and clicked into place. One key down, six to go.

The Final Keys
Over the next nine days, the trio retrieved:
The bead from Maeve’s grandmother.
A glass prism hidden inside the church spire, retrieved on March 18th by Corven.
A spiral rod found beneath the Bellweather Mine on March 20th.
A flat disc embedded in the weather vane of the old Town Hall.
A hexagonal tile retrieved from the Merrow River during a night dive.
A glass orb sealed inside a wall at the defunct Halberd Schoolhouse.
The seventh key was the most elusive — a tiny glass cube rumored to be buried in the mayor’s rose garden.


The Revelation
On March 24th, just before dawn, they acquired the final key with the reluctant help of Mayor Alistair Greaves, who admitted that his great-grandfather had been a Custodian.
Inserting the seventh key, the massive doors slid open soundlessly, revealing a cavernous atrium filled with towering glass structures. At the center was a single pedestal holding an empty slot shaped like a book.
Corven reached into his satchel and produced a plain, leather-bound volume — his late father’s journal. As soon as he placed it in the slot, the glass walls shimmered and projected a three-dimensional map of Aurendale, overlaid with glowing lines of text.
The library spoke, not in whispers, but in a voice that filled the chamber:
“The past is kept, the present is watched, the future is owed.”
From that night onward, nothing in Aurendale was ever quite the same.
